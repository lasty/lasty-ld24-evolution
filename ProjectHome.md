Ludum Dare #24 entry  (Did Not Finish)

The theme was Evolution


Did not finish in time, But I decided to dabble with it after the competition anyway, to make something playable.

Still is a debug build, and has some debug code still enabled.

Currently you can walk around and pick up gems and coins, push and shoot rocks.

_There is no real point to the game._
